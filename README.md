## üß™ How Plagiarism Detection Works

When a teacher runs plagiarism checks:

- All student submissions for an assignment are read.
- Pairwise comparison is performed using a similarity algorithm (e.g., Jaccard).
- A percentage score is calculated indicating overlap.
- Marks are deducted based on detected plagiarism.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Files are read directly using Django‚Äôs storage path, and the results are shown via a rendered report.
